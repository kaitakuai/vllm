"""Contract tests for the sampler surfaces the PoC residual depends on.

The residual in this tree adds a few hooks to the V1 sampling stack that an
out-of-tree plugin consumes: per-request ``logprobs_mode`` and
``enforced_token_ids``, ``need_processed_logprobs`` threading through the
top-k/top-p sampler, the matching ``InputBatch`` bookkeeping, and
structured-output graceful degradation. All of them live on private classes,
so a refactor can move them without producing an import error: the plugin
keeps loading and silently stops enforcing tokens or stops returning the
requested logprobs.

These tests pin the shape of each touched surface. A failure means the
surface moved and the corresponding residual patch must be re-applied at its
new location; every assertion message names the file to look at.

Scope: read-only inspection of vllm modules. No GPU, no engine startup, no
forward pass.
